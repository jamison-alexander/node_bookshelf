# NodeJS Bookshelf 

This project is (strongly) based on David Neal's guide for building a typescript Node application using Okta for authentication found [here](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript). 

The application is currently hosted in Heroku [here](https://node-bookshelf.herokuapp.com/)
